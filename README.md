# Ising Model and TDGL Equation
## Ising Model
The Ising model describes a system of spins on a lattice. It exhibits phase transitions at critical temperatures, resulting in ordered or disordered states.

## Monte-Carlo Simulation
The Python code simulates the 2D Ising model using the Metropolis algorithm. It calculates energy, magnetization, specific heat, and susceptibility.

## Configuration Snapshots
The code generates snapshots of Ising model configurations as it evolves towards equilibrium.

## Kinetic Ising Models
Explore non-conserved and conserved kinetics in Ising models, including domain growth and TDGL equations.

## TDGL Equation Simulation
Simulate the TDGL equation describing dynamics of a non-conserved scalar field.
